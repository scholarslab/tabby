## Outlook (email)
Abandon all hope

### Use rules to divert emails to folders
Possible uses: 
- Delete emails you don't want to see
- Archive and/or mark as read emails you want to be able to search for, but not read right now
- Divert certain types of emails (containing subject lines or keywords, from listservs or particular people) to folders where you can read later
E.g. I have lib-staff and lib-talk folders, so I can periodically skim these listserv messages but not have them fill my inbox. I only want to see reponses to email invites if folks _can't_ attend, so I filter emails with subject lines starting "Accepted: " to be marked as read and archived. I've started using more subject line tags to help folks know how much attention to spend on my emails: [FYI] means read/skim just if the subject line is of interest, [Action requested] means the email contains a thing for you to do, [Action possible] means the email has something you might opt to do but can also ignore.

1. Go to the "Tools" header menu and select "Rules..."
2. Click the + in the lower left of the Rules window to add a new rule

### Speed up Outlook by re-indexing
For Macs. From [this how-to](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2741535/outlook-for-mac-search-returns-no-results-and-task-items-are-not-displ), which has more info in case you run into problems (e.g. if your Outlook profile name has special characters).

Replace *DOGS* with your computer's username, and *MOREDOGS* with your Outlook profile name (see link above if you don't know what that is):
```
mdimport -g "/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter" -d1 "/Users/DOGS/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/MOREDOGS"
```

### Marking vacation/etc. days on other folks' calendars
This is **separate** from marking your own calendar to show you'll be unavailable when you're out on vacation etc., which you should also do (so anyone scheduling a meeting can see you're not available). This is just a way to particularly alert a few people (e.g. your supervisor) you're planning to be out for more than one day.
1. Change "Show as" to "free"
2. Change "Reminder" to "none"
3. Check off box for "All day event", then set Start and End dates
4. Subject "AV out" (substitute your own initials)
5. Choose the "Scheduling" icon in the upper left. To the left of each name of the folks you've added to the invite, you'll see a small purple arrow icon. Click on this icon and choose instead "Resource" from the dropdown.
These choices allow your vacation to show on folks' calendars, but *avoids* making it look like those folks are unavailable at those times when you're on vacation.
