A project [add our definition here]

- involves any staff member contributing dedicated time and work on a regular basis.

If the Scholars' Lab agrees to participate in a research project, we must seek to answer the following:

## What is the Project?

The group should produce a brief statement that explains the purpose and goals of the project. In doing so, the group shoudl strive to articulate why the work should exist, and subsequently how they and others should be affected, positively, once they've seen and used the project.
What is the Scope of the Project?

## What is the Scope of the Project?

Articulate, in list form or otherwise, the specific deliverables—features, requirements, affordances—of the project, in order to successfully realize the purpose of the project, described earlier.

## What is the current state of peer work?

The group should collect, describe, and critique any existing work, digital or otherwise, that has similar features, goals, or arguments. No project is the first of its kind in most senses.

## Who is Involved?

Identify the individuals who are part of the collaboration. Describe how each person will contribute to the project, and what possible areas of work are under their purview.

## What are the Milestones?

Decide, as a group, when work on this project should be completed. Set milestones, each with dates and a description of the work that should be finished by those dates.
